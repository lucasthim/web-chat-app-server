# Web Chat App Server

This simple Web Chat App is a personal project with the intent to learn Node.js and React.

The server side of the application was built with Node.JS.

The Web Chat App is pretty simple. The user will be requested with just a nickname to join the room and can start chatting right away. Multiple users are allowed to join the chat and all the messages can be seem by all users. Also, users get notified every time someone joins or leaves the chat room.

Upcoming features:

Save chat history on MongoDB.

Some of the tools and frameworks for faster and better coding:

Socket.IO: for a socket protocol communication between client and server.
Express: http middleware for backend.
Babel: JS compiler for development.

The client side of the application can be found at https://github.com/lucasthim/web-chat-app-client.
